# Theme Creator App

In this recap project you will create a fully functioning theme creator application. With it you can browse different color themes, create new Themes and even display an example page to test how the colors look and feel.

## Setup

### Create Vite
Setup your project by using the command: 

```bash
npm create vite@latest theme-creator
```

From the list, first choose react and then Javascript. The project will be setup for you. You can open the project by typing `cd theme-creator`. 
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure to create the project in your `wd-bootcamp` folder to avoid nested git repositories.

Install all necessary npm packages and check if the project successfully starts:
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

### Git init
Afterwards, you can go into your new project folder and initialize it as a git repository: 

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m 'initial commit'
```

Create a new Repository in your Github account and link it to your local version.

### Deployment

Deploy the React App on the Cloud Platform [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com). Follow the instructions in the Vercel Deployment Guide in your Cohort repository. 

Finally, check if your App is accessible online. 

## Project Phases

The recap project is split into 8 separate parts. Each part extends on the previous one and adds a specific functionality to the app. For each part a feature description and list of hints is provided. You can find everything in the following table.

| Part                         | Hints                      |     | Part                         | Hints                      |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------- | --- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| [Part 1](./part-1/readme.md) | [Hints](./part-1/hints.md) |     | [Part 5](./part-5/readme.md) | [Hints](./part-5/hints.md) |
| [Part 2](./part-2/readme.md) | [Hints](./part-2/hints.md) |     | [Part 6](./part-6/readme.md) | [Hints](./part-6/hints.md) |
| [Part 3](./part-3/readme.md) | [Hints](./part-3/hints.md) |     | [Part 7](./part-7/readme.md) | [Hints](./part-7/hints.md) |
| [Part 4](./part-4/readme.md) | [Hints](./part-4/hints.md) |     | [Part 8](./part-8/readme.md) | [Hints](./part-8/hints.md) |

## User Stories

Each part is written as a `user story`, a common format to describe new features in a project. It includes

- a value proposition (why a user wants this feature),
- a visual description of the feature (e.g. wireframes),
- acceptance criteria (these must be met for the feature to be functional)
- a list of tasks (guiding the developer through the creation of the feature)

Additionally, some user stories come with additional notes which help you getting started with the feature.

Good luck and enjoy this recap project! üöÄ
