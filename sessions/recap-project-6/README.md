## Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing robust database functionality while working in an agile team environment. You'll be building a full-stack application with CRUD operations and collaborative development practices.

## Core Requirements

### Database Implementation (MVP)
- Implement complete CRUD operations:
  - Create: Add new entries to the database
  - Read: Fetch and display data
  - Update: Modify existing entries
  - Delete: Remove entries from the database
- Design and implement proper database schema
- Ensure data persistence and integrity

### Agile Methodology Requirements

#### Feature Development
- Create a new feature branch for each feature
  - Format: `feature/feature-name`
  - Example: `feature/create-activity`
- Each feature must be reviewed before merging
- Follow Git best practices

#### Pull Request (PR) Process
- Submit a PR for every feature implementation
- PRs must be reviewed and approved by:
  - At least one teammate
  - A coach
- Include comprehensive PR descriptions
- Address review comments before merging

#### Team Contribution Guidelines
- Every team member must have visible contributions
- Contributions should be tracked through:
  - GitHub commits
  - Reviewed PRs
  - Code reviews
  - Documentation updates

## Sprint Structure

### Sprint 1: Database Foundation
- Implement core database functionality
- Complete initial CRUD operations
- Set up basic API endpoints

### Sprint 2: Feature Enhancement
- Teams will write and implement additional user stories
- Minimum two new CRUD-focused user stories
- Features must build upon the database foundation

## Development Process

1. **Team Setup**
   - Form teams of 3-4 members
   - Assign roles (Scrum Master, Git Master)
   - Set up project board

2. **Sprint Planning**
   - Review existing user stories
   - Create new user stories
   - Estimate effort
   - Assign tasks

3. **Development Workflow**
   - Daily stand-ups
   - Regular code reviews
   - Feature branch development
   - PR reviews and merging

4. **Documentation**
   - Update README as needed
   - Document API endpoints
   - Maintain user stories
   - Record technical decisions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Git

### Initial Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up MongoDB connection
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

### Example Data
- Sample data available in the [assets folder](./assets/)
- MongoDB example data in the [assets-db folder](./assets-db/)

## Important Notes

- This project is part of the transition from capstone to Project 6
- Branch merging will be held until the DUCKS cohort completes their capstone phase
- Focus on database operations and team collaboration
- Maintain clear communication and documentation
- Regular commits and meaningful commit messages are essential

## User Stories

- Core user stories are provided in the [sprint-1](./sprint-1/) directory
- Teams will create additional user stories in Sprint 2
- All stories must focus on database operations and CRUD functionality
