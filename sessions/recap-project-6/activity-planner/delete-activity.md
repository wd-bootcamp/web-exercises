# Delete Activity

## Value Proposition

**As a user**

**I want to** be able to delete activities that are no longer relevant,

**so that** I can maintain a clean and organised activities list, ensuring itâ€™s always up to date.

## Description

Capstone Group Todo: Add wireframes

## Acceptance Criteria

- Each activity details view includes an easily accessible delete option.
- Clicking the delete option triggers a confirmation dialog.
- The dialog serves to prevent accidental deletions by asking the user to confirm their intention.
- The dialog includes options for both confirming the deletion and cancelling the action.
- The cancellation option allows the user to back out of the deletion process if selected by mistake or if they change their mind.
- Upon confirming the deletion, the user is immediately redirected to the overview of all activities, and the activity is removed from the list.
- If all activities are deleted, a message appears indicating that there are no activities and providing an option to add new ones.
