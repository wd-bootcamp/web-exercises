# HTML Forms: Personal Profile Form

Let's create our first form!

In the `images` folder, you’ll find a screenshot showing how the completed form should look:
![Personal Profile Form](./images/final_result.png)

## Tasks

Open the `index.html` file. Inside the `<body>` element, build the form to match the layout in the screenshot.

Hints:

- You’ll need an input field with the type “color”. Look up how to set its default value to #E5430F.
- Not sure what options to include in the “Favourite Pets” dropdown menu? Try “Agra Cadabra”, “Chicken Turtle”, “Fried Egg Jellyfish”

## Notes

- You only have to touch the `index.html` file.
- There’s no need to modify the `css/styles.css` file.
- You don’t need to add any classes. The CSS is already written to target the correct HTML elements for the form.

## Development

Run `npm run start` to start a development server and open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser.
