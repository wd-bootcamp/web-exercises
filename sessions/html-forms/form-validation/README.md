# HTML Forms: Form Validation

In this challenge, you’ll work on a form that allows users to submit a complaint.

To process the complaint effectively, the company requires certain information.

## Tasks

Ensure that the user provides all the necessary information in the correct format by applying validation. Follow these guidelines:

- **First and Last Name:** These fields are required. Each must be at least 4 characters and no more than 30 characters long.
- **Age:** The user must be at least 14 years old.
- **Email Address:** A valid email address is required, containing an `@` symbol.
- **Terms of Service:** The user must confirm that they have read and agree to the terms of service.

Switch to the `index.html` file and implement form validation based on these requirements!

## Notes

- You only have to touch the `index.html` file.
- By default, the browser reloads a page when a form is submitted. In this challenge, this behavior is disabled using JavaScript (see `js/index.js`). We’ll cover this functionality in more detail during the session on JS Forms.

## Development

Run `npm run start` to start a development server and open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser.
