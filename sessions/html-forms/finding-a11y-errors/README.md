# HTML Forms: Forms and A11y

In this challenge, we’ll work on improving the accessibility of a form that allows users to submit information.

Currently, the form has several accessibility issues that need to be addressed.

## Tasks

Open the `index.html` file and make the form accessible.

The following hints may guide you:

- How can you associate the form with its headline for better accessibility?
- How can you link a description to a specific `<fieldset>` element?
- Does every interactive field have its own label?
- Are all labels properly linked to their interactive fields using the correct attributes?
- Do these connections work as expected?
  - Test it by clicking on the label in your browser. Does the corresponding input field get focused?
  - If not, could there be a spelling mistake?
- Is the provided placeholder necessary for accessibility, or could it cause confusion?

## Notes

- You only have to touch the `index.html` file.

## Development

Run `npm run start` to start a development server and open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser.
