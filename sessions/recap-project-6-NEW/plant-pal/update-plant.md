# Update Plant

## Value Proposition

**As a user**

**I want to** update the details of existing plants,

**so that** they reflect the most accurate and relevant information.

## Description

Capstone Group Todo: Add wireframes

## Acceptance Criteria

- Each plant details page includes an easily accessible edit option.
- Clicking the edit option opens a new page with a form pre-filled with the plant's existing details for modification.
- The form allows for edits to all plant details, including:
  - Plant name
  - Plant botanical name
  - Plant description
  - Plant light needs
  - Plant water needs
  - Plant fertiliser season
- The following fields are mandatory:
  - Plant name
  - Plant botanical name
  - Plant light needs
  - Plant water needs
- The form section includes options for both saving and cancelling the action.
- The cancellation option allows the user to back out of the edit process if selected by mistake or if they change their mind.
- Submissions with empty required fields are blocked, with validation messages indicating the missing required fields.
- Upon confirming the save, the user is immediately redirected to the details page of the edited plant, and the changes are saved and reflected.
