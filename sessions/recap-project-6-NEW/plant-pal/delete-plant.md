# Delete Plant

## Value Proposition

**As a user**

**I want to** delete plants that are no longer relevant,

**so that** I can maintain a clean and organised plant list, ensuring it’s always up to date.

## Description

Capstone Group Todo: Add wireframes

## Acceptance Criteria

- Each plant details view includes an easily accessible delete option.
- Clicking the delete option triggers a confirmation dialog.
- The dialog serves to prevent accidental deletions by asking the user to confirm their intention.
- The dialog includes options for both confirming the deletion and cancelling the action.
- The cancellation option allows the user to back out of the deletion process if selected by mistake or if they change their mind.
- Upon confirming the deletion, the user is immediately redirected to the overview of all plants, and the plant is removed from the list.
- If all plants are deleted, a message appears indicating that there are no plants and providing an option to add new ones.
