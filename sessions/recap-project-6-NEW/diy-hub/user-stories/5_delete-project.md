# Delete Project

## Value Proposition

**As a user**

**I want to** be able to delete projects that are no longer relevant,

**so that** I can maintain a clean and organized projects list, ensuring it's always up to date.

## Description

The delete project feature provides a safe way to remove projects from the database. Available from the project details page, it includes a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletions. The interface clearly communicates the permanent nature of deletion and provides feedback throughout the process. After successful deletion, users are automatically redirected to the main project list, which updates to reflect the removal.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Each project details view includes an easily accessible delete option.
- Clicking the delete option triggers a confirmation dialog.
- The dialog serves to prevent accidental deletions by asking the user to confirm their intention.
- The dialog includes options for both confirming the deletion and cancelling the action.
- Upon confirming the deletion:
  - The project document is removed from MongoDB
  - The user is redirected to the projects list
  - A success message is displayed
  - The projects list is automatically updated
- If the deletion fails:
  - An error message is displayed
  - The user remains on the details page
  - The user can retry the deletion
- If all projects are deleted:
  - A message appears indicating that there are no projects
  - An option to add new ones is provided
  - This state is reflected in MongoDB (empty collection)
