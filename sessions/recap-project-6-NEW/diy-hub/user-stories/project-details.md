# Project Details

## Value Proposition

**As a user**

**I want to** access detailed information about each project,

**so that** I can effectively utilize the information to complete my DIY projects.

## Description

The project details page provides a comprehensive view of a single project. When a user clicks on a project card from the list, they are taken to this dedicated page that shows all available information about the project. The page features a clean, organized layout with the project's image prominently displayed, followed by its title, complexity level, duration, materials list, and step-by-step instructions. Navigation controls allow easy return to the main list.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Each project in the projects list has a link to a details page using MongoDB's unique document ID.
- The details page fetches specific project data from MongoDB using the project ID.
- Each details page contains:
  - Project title
  - Project image
  - Project description
  - Project complexity
  - Project duration
  - Project materials list
  - Project steps list
  - Creation date
  - Last update date
- The detailed view includes a "back" link, allowing users to easily navigate back to the list of projects.
- The page implements proper error handling for non-existent project IDs.
- The page shows a loading state while fetching project details.
