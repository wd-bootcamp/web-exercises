## Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing robust database functionality while working in an agile team environment. You'll be building a full-stack application with CRUD operations and collaborative development practices.

## Core Requirements

### Database Implementation (MVP)

- Implement complete CRUD operations:
  - Create: Add new entries to the database
  - Read: Fetch and display data
  - Update: Modify existing entries
  - Delete: Remove entries from the database
- Design and implement proper database schema
- Ensure data persistence and integrity

### Agile Methodology Requirements

#### Feature Development

- Create a new feature branch for each feature
  - Format: `feature/feature-name`
  - Example: `feature/create-activity`
- Each feature must be reviewed before merging
- Follow Git best practices

#### Pull Request (PR) Process

- Submit a PR for every feature implementation
- PRs must be reviewed and approved by:
  - At least one teammate
  - A coach
- Include comprehensive PR descriptions
- Address review comments before merging

#### Team Contribution Guidelines

- Every team member must have visible contributions
- Contributions should be tracked through:
  - GitHub commits
  - Reviewed PRs
  - Code reviews
  - Documentation updates

## Sprint Structure

### Sprint 1: Database Foundation

- Implement core database functionality
- Complete initial CRUD operations
- Set up basic API endpoints

### Sprint 2: Feature Enhancement

- Teams will write and implement additional user stories
- Minimum two new CRUD-focused user stories
- Features must build upon the database foundation

## Development Process

1. **Team Setup**

   - Form teams of 3-4 members
   - Assign roles (Scrum Master, Git Master)
   - Set up project board

2. **Sprint Planning**

   - Review existing user stories
   - Create new user stories
   - Estimate effort
   - Assign tasks

3. **Development Workflow**

   - Daily stand-ups
   - Regular code reviews
   - Feature branch development
   - PR reviews and merging

4. **Documentation**
   - Update README as needed
   - Document API endpoints
   - Maintain user stories
   - Record technical decisions

## Getting Started

### Project Setup

Follow the instructions [here](https://web-capstone-docs.neuefische.de/guides/project-setup#create-a-template-for-user-stories-using-the-following-markdown-template)

## Important Notes

- Focus on database operations and team collaboration
- Maintain clear communication and documentation
- Regular commits and meaningful commit messages are essential

## User Stories

- Core user stories are provided in the `user-stories` directory
- Teams will create additional user stories in Sprint 2
- All stories must focus on database operations and CRUD functionality
