# JS Functions: Progress Bar

Your task is to build a progress bar that visually indicates how much of the page the user has scrolled. Follow the instructions below to achieve this.

## Tasks

1. **Start with the CSS**

- Set the initial width of the progress bar to 0% in the `styles.css` file.
- The goal is for the progress bar to grow in width as the user scrolls down the page.

2. **Write the `calculateScrollPercentage` function**

- This function should calculate and return the percentage of the page that the user has scrolled.
- Use the following properties:
  - `window.scrollY`: The Y position of the window on the total webpage.
  - `window.innerHeight`: The height of the visible part of the window.
  - `document.body.clientHeight`: The total height of the webpage.

3. **Update the Progress Bar**

- Add an event listener for the `"scroll"` event on the `document`.
- Inside the event listener, call the `calculateScrollPercentage` function to calculate the current scroll percentage.
- Update the width of the progress bar using the calculated percentage.
  > ðŸ’¡ You can change the width of an element like this: `element.style.width = '50%'`.

## Notes

- You only have to touch the `./js/index.js` and `./css/styles.css` files.
