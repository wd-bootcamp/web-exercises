# JS Functions: Pizza Analyzer

Pizza is amazing. Letâ€™s build a tool that compares two pizza sizes and calculates how much more pizza we get for our money.

## Tasks

### Calculate the Pizza Gain

We want to calculate the difference in area between two pizzas of different diameters.

1. Write a function `calculatePizzaGain` that expects the diameters of the two pizzas: `diameter1` and `diameter2`. (Not the radii of the pizzas!)
2. Inside this function, calculate the areas of both pizzas.
   > ðŸ’¡ You can find the formula for the area of a circle online. The value of pi can be accessed via `Math.PI`.
3. Calculate the pizza gain in percent relative to the first pizza. The formula is: `(area2 - area1) / area1 * 100`.
4. Set the `textContent` of the output element to that value. Use `Math.round(calculatedValue)` to round the pizza gain to the nearest whole number.
5. Inside both event listeners, save the current values of the pizza input fields in two variables: `pizzaSize1` and `pizzaSize2`.
   > ðŸ’¡ You can use the queried elements and get their values like this: `pizzaInput.value`.
6. Call the function and pass in the two pizza sizes as arguments.

### Change Pizza Display Sizes

Great! Now we know how much pizza we gain if we choose the second pizza. But we don't have any visual representation of this difference. Let's adapt the pizza displays.

1. Write a function `updatePizzaDisplay` with two parameters:
   - `pizzaElement`: The queried DOM element of the respective pizza.
   - `newSize`: The new size of that pizza.
2. Calculate the new display size of the pizza element. The formula is: `newSize / 24 * 100`.
3. Set the width of the `pizzaElement` to this new value.
   > ðŸ’¡ Use `pizzaElement.style.width` for that. Remember that the width value requires a unit. Add "px" to your calculated value.
4. Call this function in both event listeners, passing in the correct pizza element and pizza size.

### Bonus: Change the Output Background

Let's update the background of the output display to indicate whether we gain or loose pizza by choosing pizza 2.

1. Write a function `updateOutputColor` with two parameters: `size1` and `size2`.
2. Set the background color of the `outputSection`:
   - Use `"var(--red)"` if we loose pizza.
   - Use `"var(--green)"` if we gain pizza.
3. Call this function in both event listeners with the correct sizes as arguments.

> ðŸ’¡ `var(--<variable-name>)` allows you to use predefined CSS variables. In this case, the color codes are stored in the `--red` and `--green` variables in the `:root` element of the HTML document. Check the CSS file for details.

## Notes

- You only have to touch the `js/index.js` file.

## Development

To work locally, please install the dependencies using `npm i` first.

Run `npm run start` to start a development server and open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser.
